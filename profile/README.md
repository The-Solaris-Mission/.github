# Welcome to SOLARIS üåå

## Society for Outer Life and Advanced Research on Interstellar Settlements

**"Humanity was born on Earth, but it was never meant to die here."**

At SOLARIS, we are driven by the vision to make humanity a multi-planetary species. We are a global research organization dedicated to pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and technology in space exploration. Our work spans across propulsion systems, astrobiology, space settlement design, and the search for habitable exoplanets.

### üöÄ Our Mission
To develop technologies and solutions that enable humanity to thrive beyond Earth. Our key focus areas include:
- **Propulsion Systems for Interstellar Travel**: Developing advanced propulsion technologies to travel vast distances between stars.
- **Astrobiology**: Exploring the conditions required for life beyond Earth.
- **Space Settlements**: Designing sustainable habitats for human life in space.
- **Exoplanet Exploration**: Identifying and studying planets that could support human life.

### üåü Our Vision
We envision a future where humans live, work, and thrive on multiple planets and in space habitats across the stars. Our long-term goal is to develop the knowledge and technologies that will make this vision a reality.

### üõ†Ô∏è How We Work
SOLARIS combines theoretical research with practical innovation in a collaborative, global community setting. We believe in starting with what we can do now, leveraging existing technologies and knowledge to solve the grand challenges of interstellar travel and colonization.
